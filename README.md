## CS F364 Design And Analysis Of Algorithms

## Convex Hull
The convex hull of a set of points in space is essentially the smallest "shape" that wraps around all those points, with no corners bending inwards.

### Convex Hull Algorithms Implemented
- Jarvis March Algorithm
- Kirk Patrick Seidel Algorithm

## How to Run 

Go to client directory

```bash
cd client
```

Install required node modules
